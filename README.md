    <h1 align="center" >Meenakashi Amman Temple</h1>
    <p align="center">The history of the Meenakshi Amman Temple is a story of ancient origins, 
        destruction, and reconstruction, largely shaped by the Pandyan and Nayak kings,
         with its roots in the Pandya dynasty over 800 years ago. While its exact ancient origins are unclear, 
         parts of the current structure date back to the Pandyan King Kula Shekara. The temple suffered significant destruction in the 
        14th century during an invasion, but was later restored and expanded over centuries, with 
        the Nayak dynasty from the 16th century being credited for much of its present splendor.
